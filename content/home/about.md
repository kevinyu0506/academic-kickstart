# ***About Me***

Throughout my academic years at **<a href="http://www.nccu.edu.tw/?locale=en">National Chengchi University (NCCU)</a>**, I’ve participated in several internships all related to **Mobile Application Industry**. I’m passionate about developing any interesting app that users might like, the thought that my app might actually influence people gives me the motivation to keep improving the skills I’ve possessed.

For the past year, I’ve been working as a **Software QA Engineering intern** in a cross-national start-up **<a href="https://omlet.gg/">MobiSocial Inc.**</a> that originated in **<a href="https://mobisocial.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>**. Our main goal is to make **<a href="https://omlet.gg/">Omlet Arcade**</a> the largest **Mobile Gaming Social Platform**.

Currently, I'm enrolled in a master program for **Information Management** at **<a href="http://www.management.ntu.edu.tw/IM">National Taiwan Univeristy (NTU)**</a> and expected to receive my MS Degree around 2022.

<!-- I am an undergraduate student majoring MIS at **<a href="http://www.nccu.edu.tw/?locale=en">NCCU</a>**, currently focused on combining **Android Application Development** with **Performance Improvement**.
