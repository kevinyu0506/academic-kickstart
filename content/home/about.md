# Biography

I am an undergraduate student majoring Management Information Systems at <a href="http://www.nccu.edu.tw/?locale=en">NCCU</a>, currently focused on enhancing my skills in Android Application Development using Java as well as implementing Visual Recognition service provided by IBM Watson into it. I worked with <a href="http://www.commerce.nccu.edu.tw/en/faculty/faculty_directory_bydept/%E5%B0%9A-%E5%AD%9D%E7%B4%94-52949454" target="_blank">Prof. SHIAW-CHUN SHANG</a> and also one of her EMBA student, Mr. ALEX YANG, on Business Model Innovation aimed at impoving Taiwan's<a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/earlywarning/">Earthquake Early Warning system</a>. We eventually developed an Android Application prototype "Earthquake Early-Warning Application - H.E.R.O." which won the 1st Place in NCCU MIS 2014 Academic Year Graduation Project. I have also worked with <a href="http://rmi.nccu.edu.tw/en/Members1/%E9%BB%83-%E6%B3%93%E6%99%BA-93151481">Prof. HONG-CHIH HUANG</a> on building a <a href="http://140.119.86.174/quant168/newretirementpay.php">Financial Investment and Management website</a> using programing languages such as PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML.

I am expected to receive my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from NCCU at 2018. Over the course of my Undergraduate study I took an intership at a startup company called <a href="http://www.evertiphi.com/">Evertiphi Inc.</a>, which was founded by the Mr. ALEX YANG based on the prototype we developed. I worked as an Android Application Developer Intern and kept on completing the fully functional version of H.E.R.O., and we finally launched our APP on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evertiphi.herov2">Google Play</a> at the end of 2017 .
