# Bio

I am an undergraduate student majoring MIS at <a href="http://www.nccu.edu.tw/?locale=en">NCCU</a>, currently focused on Android Application Developing using Java. I worked with <a href="http://www.mis2.nccu.edu.tw/en/Faculty/Faculty_01/SHIAW-CHUN-SHANG-1784053" target="_blank">Prof. SHIAW-CHUN SHANG</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-yang-3045392a/">Mr. ALEX YANG</a> on business model innovation in improving Taiwan's <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/earlywarning/">Earthquake Early Warning (E.E.W.)</a> system. Together we developed a sensor-based Android Application called "<a href="https://github.com/kevinyu0506/EarthquakeApp">H.E.R.O. - Help Everyone Run Out</a>". Previously, I have also worked with <a href="http://rmi.nccu.edu.tw/en/Members1/%E9%BB%83-%E6%B3%93%E6%99%BA-93151481">Prof. HONG-CHIH HUANG</a> on building a personal finance website "<a href="http://140.119.86.174/quant168/newretirementpay.php">Quant168</a>" using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and etc.

I am expected to receive my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from NCCU at 2018. Over the courses of my undergraduate study I took an internship at a startup company <a href="http://www.evertiphi.com/">Evertiphi Inc.</a> founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-yang-3045392a/">Mr. ALEX YANG</a> based on the prototype (H.E.R.O.) we had developed together. I worked as a part-time Android Application Developer Intern and kept on completing the fully functional version of H.E.R.O.. As for now, we have just launched the beta version of H.E.R.O. on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evertiphi.herov2">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/h-e-r-o-earthquake-alert/id1276497257?mt=8">Apple Store</a> at the end of 2017.
