# Biography

I am an undergraduate student majoring MIS at **<a href="http://www.nccu.edu.tw/?locale=en">NCCU</a>**, currently focused on combining **Android Application Development** with **Deep Learning Model** in my exchange semester at **<a href="http://www.ust.hk">HKUST</a>**. I worked with **<a href="http://www.mis2.nccu.edu.tw/en/Faculty/Faculty_01/SHIAW-CHUN-SHANG-1784053" target="_blank">Prof. SHARI SHANG</a>** and **<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-yang-3045392a/">Mr. ALEX YANG</a>** on improving Taiwan's **<a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/earlywarning/">Earthquake Early Warning (E.E.W.)</a>** system by developing an **Award-Winning** **Android Application** **"<a href="https://github.com/kevinyu0506/EarthquakeApp">H.E.R.O. - Help Everyone Run Out</a>"**. Previously, I have also worked with **<a href="http://rmi.nccu.edu.tw/en/Members1/%E9%BB%83-%E6%B3%93%E6%99%BA-93151481">Prof. JERRY HUANG</a>** on building a personal finance website **"<a href="http://140.119.86.174/quant168/index.php">Quant168</a>"** using languages such as PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, HTML.

Over the courses of my undergraduate study, I participated in the early-establishment of a **Startup Company** **<a href="http://www.evertiphi.com/">Evertiphi Inc.</a>** with **<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-yang-3045392a/">Mr. ALEX YANG</a>** base on the earthquake project we had developed previously. I worked as an **Android Developer Intern** there and kept on completing the fully functional version of H.E.R.O., expecting to upgrade Taiwan's E.E.W. system in the near future. As for now, we have launched the beta version of H.E.R.O. on both **<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evertiphi.herov2">Google Play</a>** and **<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/h-e-r-o-earthquake-alert/id1276497257?mt=8">Apple Store</a>** at the end of 2017.
